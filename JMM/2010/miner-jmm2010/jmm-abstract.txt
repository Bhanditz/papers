55101. MathType, Math Markup, and the Goal of Cut and Paste.

One consequence of the rise of the Web as an information source and
application platform is the expectation of easy reuse. The ability to
cut and paste text data between web pages and applications greatly
enhances the utility of both the source and target. This presentation
examines the state of the art for cut and paste of mathematical
notation in Web pages.

For display, most math on the web is represented in a relatively
unstructured way, e.g. as an image. By contrast, the applications that
are most naturally the targets of mathematical paste operations
generally require highly structured representations. However, the rise
of important web applications such as blogs and wikis have made the
association of equation images with more structured representations in
metadata more common. Such data is most often a TeX-like
language. Conversely, efforts to standardize exchange formats for
mathematics, particularly MathML, have seen steadily increasing
support in target applications. The combination of these factors now
allows software tools, such as Design Science's MathType, to cut and
paste mathematics naturally between a surprising variety of sources
and targets.
