\begin{abstract}
  Accessibility of mathematics is still a challenging problem and providing the
  right level of support to a reader depends on many factors, such as their
  particular assistive technology needs, their level of expertise, and the
  subject area they are working in. We present work towards making maths
  accessibility more adaptable to the reader's personal needs that is
  implemented in the MathJax library for rendering mathematics on the web. While
  MathJax provided accessibility support for several years, the new version 3
  has both more new features and means of personalisation. In particular, it
  provides adaptable combinations of highlighting, colorisation, and
  magnification techniques. Both Braille and speech output can be generated,
  with different speech rule sets allowing readers to flexibly change
  presentation and adaptation for improved interpretation of formulas in
  different subject areas, like Physics, Chemistry, and Logic.

\section{Introduction}

Assistive technology support for mathematical expressions has always been a
challenging problem that is characterised by a number of often competing
affordances and requirements: There exist multiple markup languages in which to
represent formulas, even in the same markup language multiple ways exist to
describe a given formula, readers often have different assistive technology
needs, they have different levels of expertise, or work with material from
different subject areas.

Consequently, a number of technology solutions have experimented with over time
to support different aspects of the problem. From software for generating Math
Braille~\cite{maddox2007mathematical}, over dedicated screen readers that work
on different input languages~\cite{raman1994aster,soiffer2005mathplayer}, to
tools for dyslexia support~\cite{equatio}, etc. Some of these systems also
support different areas of mathematics although mainly geared towards
high-school curricula.

Modern web technology offers the possibility to combine these features in a
single medium by augmenting DOM structure with custom data on alternative format
information without altering visual representation. In
MathJax~\cite{MathJax2.7}, a Javascript library for TeX-quality typesetting of
Mathematics on the web, we have exploited this approach since version 2.7 to
provide an accessibility extension that aims to give flexible support for
readers visual and print impairments (i.e., readers with cognitive disorders
like dyslexia)~\cite{cervone2016towards}.  Although MathJax can render the three
most common markup language for Mathematics ({\LaTeX}, ASCIIMath, MathML),
none of these has sufficient semantic information to allow for sufficient
accessibility support. Consequently MathJax relies on an improved semantic
interpretation of formulas, which is provided by the Speech Rule Engine
(SRE)~\cite{SRE}, a system that provides speech generation for mathematical
expressions given in presentation MathML.

In this paper we present, how embedded semantics is employed to provide a number
of assistive technology features in MathJax, with a particular emphasis on
features new to version 3 and personalisation aspects, that exploit SRE's
advanced features like Braille generation, adaptations for reading style and to
subject areas, like Physics, Chemistry, and Logic.


% SRE has been augmented with a number of additional features in recent
% years that can be exposed in MathJax directly.  In addition, we have added new,
% bespoke features in MathJax itself, which are mainly aimed at supporting readers
% with low vision or learning impairments.

% In this paper we describe the current state of math accessibility in MathJax,
% presenting both features that exist in version~2.7~\cite{cervone2016towards} and
% are novel to version~3. We will concentrate in particular on the novel adaptable
% features and personalisation aspects of the new version.






% has as its mission to provide not only visiual mathematics rendering on all
% browsers and platforms, but also
% accessibility support for blind and visually impaired people. This is achieved
% either by supporting third-party assistive technology or, more recently, via
% it's own integrated accessibility extensions. In MathJax's new version 3, the
% accessibility extensions remain not only an important feature, but have been
% considerably improved in terms of the information they can provide on formulas.

% For expressions entered in {\LaTeX} format, an additional
% emphasis is to provide better accessibility to advanced mathematical
% material exploiting information gained from the original {\LaTeX} code, to provide
% more appropriate speech for different areas of Mathematics, but also for subjects
% like Physics, Chemistry and Logic.  Our aim is to ease the study of mathematics
% for more people with visual impairments, as well as to encourage subject
% specialists to contribute via better authored content, semantically meaningful
% {\LaTeX} packages, and expert knowledge for speech generation.


% Personalisation aspects:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Automatic voicing of formulas
% \item Interactive navigation with synchronised highlighting
% \item Different collections of speech rules like MathSpeak and ClearSpeak
% \item Nemeth Braille output
% \item Subject specific voicing for advanced mathematics
% \item Different magnification and zoom engines
% \item Variety of highlighting styles
% \end{itemize}

% All this depends on a rich semantic representation of mathematical formulas.

% Although MathJax can render the three most common markup language for
% Mathematics --- {\LaTeX}, ASCIIMath, and MathML --- none of these has sufficient
% semantic information to easily allow for the generation of meaningful speech,
% explanations, or subject-specific highlighting.

\section{Semantic Enrichment}
\label{sec:semantic-enrichment}

One of the main challenges to produce useful assistive technology support in
MathJax is the lack of semantic information in most standard mathematical markup
notations. Formulas are usually given in format that are geared towards visual
representations, such as {\LaTeX}, ASCIIMath, or MathML, with {\LaTeX} being
clearly prevalent on the majority of webpages. Similarly, MathJax was originally
designed exclusively for displaying formulas, offering a number of different
rendering solutions, such as HTML with CSS or SVG output.
Figure~\ref{fig:semantic-tree} presents two standard ways of representing the
quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, in {\LaTeX} on the top and in MathML on
the left. Both are given in a flat structure, that is sufficient for a linear
representation but in general is not enough to create good mathematical
explanations and interaction support.

Consequently, the first step towards accessibility support in MathJax is by
imposing a semantic interpretation on a given math expression and generating a
tree representation that can be embedded into rendered MathJax expressions to
ensure a similar user experience across browsers. The idea of the semantic
interpretation is an extension of the heuristics implemented in the screen
reader ChromeVox~\cite{Sorge14} and further developed in the context of
MathJax~\cite{cervone2016towards}, which effectively rewrites a flat expression
into a term tree structure by first interpreting the basic nature of symbols, and
propagating this through the expression to determines the scope of operators,
relations, etc. Figure~\ref{fig:semantic-tree} presents this transformation for
the example of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, which is rewritten
from either its MathML or {\LaTeX} form into its semantic interpretation on the
right.

The resulting semantic tree can be understood as an orthogonal view of the
mathematical expression. To exploit it, we embed it using \texttt{data}
attributes into the DOM elements that represent MathJax's rendering of the
equation regardless of the choice of a particular rendering solution. MathJax
offers several different output formats, where expressions in the DOM are
collections of \texttt{div} and \texttt{span} elements, HTML5 custom elements,
or SVG graphics elements. These collections often don't correspond well to the
mathematical structures they represent.  Figure~\ref{fig:rendered} contains the
MathJax's DOM output using HTML5 custom elements. \texttt{data} attributes
\texttt{type}, \texttt{role}, \texttt{id}, \texttt{parent}, \texttt{children},
\texttt{content}, and \texttt{speech} are injected (here the
\texttt{data-semantic-} prefix is omitted to preserve space and improve
readability). The actual semantic tree structure is represented via the
\texttt{id}, \texttt{parent}, \texttt{children}, and \texttt{content}
attributes. Note that data attributes provide a fast and standardized means of
retrieving information from the DOM that is fully consistent with HTML5
practices.


\section{Accessibility Features}
\label{sec:at-solution}

The assistive technology extension that we have built for MathJax is mainly
aimed at supporting users with reading disorders, such as dyslexia, and visual
impairments. However, some aspects if it could also be used as a general aid for
readers unfamiliar with the content or for learners at different levels. We
summarize the main features in this section.

\subsection{Speech Output}

One main emphasis of the assistive technology extension is to support
screen-reader users, but make them independent of their particular
screen-reader's Math capabilities. MathJax exploits the features of the
speech-rule engine~\cite{Sorge14,SRE} that generates the initial semantic-tree
transformation to also provide aural rendering for mathematical
expressions. Speech-string computation is based on the embedded semantic
tree. Speech strings for a formula are either generated on the fly when running
MathJax in a browser client, or pre-computed by a page author, e.g.,
if formulas are embedded as pre-rendered elements into a page.

To expose the speech strings to a screen reader, MathJax uses two main
techniques.  Firstly, a description of an entire formula is given in the ARIA
label at the top level of the DOM structure representing the expression.
Figure~\ref{fig:rendered} demonstrates the ARIA label embedding as well as the
use of a custom data attribute for speech. The latter allows us to aurally
render not only the entire formula but each of its subexpressions, which is
exploited during user interaction with the formula, as discussed below.  For
this purpose, MathJax introduces a dedicated assertive ARIA live region into the
DOM and updates it with the desired speech output. Content changes in the live region
are picked up by screen readers and spoken. This is a feature that is
particularly in line with MathJax's mission to support mathematics
rendering in all browsers and on all platforms, working with any modern screen
reader that supports live regions.


\subsection{Tactile Output}

In addition to speech output, SRE now provides generation of Braille
output using Unicode Braille symbols. It currently supports translation of
expressions into Nemeth Braille~\cite{nemeth1972nemeth} only, but we plan to support
additional Math Braille styles in the future. In MathJax we can make use of this
feature by computing Nemeth output as a further rendering mode in parallel to
visiual and speech output.

Unfortunately, there is currently no easy way to get tactile output to the user
during regular reading, as most screen readers translate text internally into
Braille, which is not necessarily helpful for Mathematics that needs specific
Braille formats. In particular there is no way to inject Braille directly into
alt text or aria labels for screen readers to simply pick it up and pass it on.
However, during user interaction with a formula, MathJax takes control so that
Braille content can be exposed. This is similar to speech: The unicode Braille
is simply pushed into a second live region which can be picked up by a screen
reader that directly pushes it onto a connected Braille display.

\def\myparagraph#1{\vspace{1ex}\noindent\textbf{#1} ---}

\subsection{Visual Aids}

Since MathJax has full control over the rendering of a mathematical expression
in the browser, it can offer a number of assistive techniques based on visual
alteration and enhancement of formulae. While these are mainly geared towards
supporting readers with low vision or other print impairments like dyslexia,
they can also help a general audience in improved understanding for formulas and
their structure.

\myparagraph{Highlighting and Contrast} Math expressions generally are large
collections of mostly unconnected symbols in a two-dimensional layout that can
be particularly daunting for readers with dyslexia.  Reading comprehension can
be supported, however, by a choice of high-contrast
colors~\cite{rello2012optimal} and selective
highlighting~\cite{jones2008strategies}. We realize this in MathJax by offering
changes of fore- and background colors, and selective highlighting of
sub-expressions of a complex formula. In the case of the former, the entire
formula is simply colored to simulate a colored overlay to provide high-contrast
in itself or to offset it from the surrounding text.  For the latter, we again
exploit the semantic structure of the formula to provide a more meaningful
highlighting of sub-formulas. Below is a simple example of progressive shading
for the quadratic equation:
\def\cb#1{\colorbox{yellow}{\ensuremath{\!\!\displaystyle#1\!\!}}}
\def\cc#1{\colorbox{GreenYellow}{\ensuremath{\!\!\displaystyle#1\!\!}}}
\[\cc{\cb{ax^2} + \cb{bx} + \cb{c}} = \cc{\rule[3ex]{0pt}{0pt}0}\]
In practice, sub-expressions are highlighted when hovering over them with the
mouse pointer, or by switching highlighting on permanently. This can be
recursively refined for sub-expressions, e.g., hovering on the denominator or
numerator of a fraction only. For permanent highlighting, the opaqueness of the
background gradually increases in nested sub-expressions. Nevertheless, in large
expressions, highlighting is of limited utility in getting an overview of the structure
of a formula; to aid this further, we introduce a technique for
structural abstraction in the next section.

\myparagraph{Structural Abstraction}
The idea of structural abstraction is to assist readers by simplifying the
structure of the formula initially and letting them individually explore the
equation by manually expanding selected sub-expressions. Below is an example of
structural abstraction for the quadratic equation, where the left-hand side is
collapsed into a single addition symbol that can be expanded to the full sum by
clicking on it.
\[\collapse{+}=0\]
While in this case the abstraction is fairly trivial (for some more complex
examples see~\cite{cervone2016towards}), for large or complex formulas and
equation systems, abstraction can often significantly simplify the visual
appearance, leading to less cognitive load for a reader, as well as a better
understanding of the basic structure of an expression. In addition, abstractions
can aid in producing concise speech descriptions via summarisation of formulas
or parts thereof. This can be particularly important for presenting formulas
inline in mathematical texts, where a reader might want to understand the whole
text without having their reading flow constantly interrupted by every formula
being spoken in minute detail. In addition, visual abstraction can be helpful in
presenting mathmatics on small form factor displays by adapting formulas to the
page reflow to avoid the need for left right panning of a page.


\myparagraph{Formula Colouring}
An alternative means to providing support to readers with print impairments is
to heighten the contrast of elements within a formula itself. This effectively
amounts to offsetting neighbouring symbols as much as possible with contrasting
colors. While this could be done in a linear fashion, exploiting the semantic
tree structure allows for a similar effect while also offering the possibility
of retaining the same or similar colors for the same or similar operations. A
tree colouring example for the quadratic equation is given below:
\[\color{blue}a \color{OliveGreen}x^2 \color{red}+ \color{blue}b
  \color{OliveGreen}x \color{red}+ \color{blue}c \color{black}= \color{magenta}0\]

\myparagraph{Magnification}
While changing contrasts can already help low-vision users, many rely on screen
magnification to read content.  MathJax supports magnification in multiple ways:
standard browser zoom is supported by re-rendering mathematics at the new size.
MathJax also provides global scaling settings to enlarge all math elements at
once.  Individual math expressions can be further magnified using a ``lens''
that ordinarily offers a zoom window on top of an expression, with scrolling to
pan across the entire zoomed expression. Exploiting the semantic markup,
magnification can also be restricted to particular sub-expressions only, as in
the example below.


\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{magnification}  
\end{center}


\subsection{Interactive Features}

Since mathematical formulas are generally of a complex nature, and already a
small formula can make for a complex utterance, just listening to an expression
once is generally not enough for comprehension. Therefore, it is particularly
important to provide the reader with a means of engaging with formulas
interactively. MathJax offers an interface for interactive exploration of
mathematical expressions that allows a reader to step through sub-expressions.
Technically, this is realized by giving each math expression an ARIA role of
\texttt{application}, and upon entering an expression, the user can walk it
using the cursor keys.

During this exploration, many of the previously described features can be
restricted to sub-expressions as well. Speech strings can be
computed for all sub-expressions and voiced by updating the ARIA live region
introduced in the DOM. Similarly highlighting as well as magnification can be
synchronised to the exploration using CSS techniques.

It is important to note that the walking is not done in a linear
``left-to-right'' fashion, but instead follows the embedded semantic tree
structure. Thus starting with the entire expression, the next lower level
consists, for instance in the case of the quadratic equation, of the sum on the
left hand side of the equation, the equality sign and the $0$ on the right.  The
sum can then be further explored allowing the reader to then step through the
single summands from left to right, and so on.  Note also that this
ensures that the user experience of exploring a structure is the same regardless
of the specific renderer used even though their underlying DOM trees differ.
In addition to this, MathJax also provides the ability to
query the position of elements in a formula, means to summarise the expression currently
highlighted, cursor virtualisation, as well as special navigation modes for
matrices and equation systems.


\section{Adaptation and Personalisation}
\label{sec:challenges}

\subsection{Altering Speech}

MathSpeak~\cite{MathSpeak} vs ClearSpeak~\cite{frankel2016development}

Example: Quadratic formula

\subsection{Domain Specific Semantics}

\begin{itemize}
\item Domain specific interpretation from {\LaTeX}
\item Domain adaptation by choice of heuristics
\item Example: Bra-ket notation.
\end{itemize}



\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

\edbf{Rewrite entirely or just point to future work.}

We have presented the new accessibility features of MathJax that aim to
transform MathJax into a universal rendering solution supporting all readers,
regardless of their assistive needs. The features are based on a improved semantic
enrichment procedure for Presentation MathML, which not only ensures a uniform
user experience across platforms and output formats, but also shows promise
for more advanced AT techniques in the future. Some of these features are available
as extensions to MathJax version~2, but all will be included as part of the core
distribution for MathJax version~3.

Although we have not yet had the opportunity to do extensive user testing, since
our code is developed publicly on our GitHub repository, we have already had
some user feedback, in particular from specialists, where initial reactions have
been positive. Additional end-user testing was enligthening: users struggled 
with lack of live-regions support in their AT and the complexity of the 
application. Feedback indicates that options for additional speech styles and 
semantics will be beneficial. 
We spent a significant effort on
technical testing in order to make the solution compatible with the most common
assistive technology solutions, and
strongly believe that these experiences and
observed shortcomings should serve as a foundation for the future development
of standards, tools, and general accessibility solutions for STEM content on the
web.
